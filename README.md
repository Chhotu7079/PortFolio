# Portfolio - Manya Jain
As an individual driven by the pursuit of knowledge and improvement, I embarked on the creation of this portfolio intending to document my progress and showcase the diverse skills and experiences I accumulated along the way.

As I grow and learn, this portfolio will act as a living document, evolving in tandem with my experiences and skill acquisition. From coding projects to creative endeavors, professional milestones to personal reflections, this space encapsulates the essence of my continuous journey towards self-improvement.

I invite you to explore this portfolio, witness my progression, and join me on this dynamic expedition of growth and discovery.
